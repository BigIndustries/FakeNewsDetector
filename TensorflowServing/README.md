# Tensorflow Serving
This is an unfinished part of this git. This git will handle the installation of Tensorflow serving but nothing more.

Tensorflow serving is an easy way to deploy a new machine learning model or experiment to an existing architecture.
For more information about Tensorflow Serving follow [this link](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/) . 

## Installation Tensorflow Serving

run installationTensorflowServing.sh {"True"/"False"} 

i.e. ./installationTensorflowServing.sh "True"

1. True: Install bazel
2. False: Do not install bazel

This script will install every dependency you need to have to install a Tensorflow serving.


## createAndDeployTensorFlowServing.md
The markdown with name createAndDeployTensorFlowServing.md will contain a link to a webpage where there is a tutorial located to create and deploy a Tensorflow serving server.
