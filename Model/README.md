# Model

This section will be used for building and testing the model. At this time we are going to use an [example model](https://github.com/inikdom/neural-sentiment) to try understand  machine learning.
When this model is build and trained. We are going to try deploying this with TensorSpark. When all of this works then we will try changing the model to the Fake News Detector Algoritm. 
## Installation
run: installationTestModel.sh

### Prerequisite
1.Install Python 2.7.X
2.Install Tensorflow
These two technologies must be installed before running the script. These are installed with previous script of us.

### Script
1. Install nltk
2. Open Python script and download nltk
3. Install punkt package

### Problems
When you encounter problems with training the model (long waiting time) you can look into this [github](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark) for a possible solution
